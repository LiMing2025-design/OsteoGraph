# Deep Learning-Based Action Recognition for Analyzing Drug-Induced Bone Remodeling Mechanisms

This repository contains the implementation of a novel deep learning-based framework designed to analyze drug-induced bone remodeling mechanisms. The goal of this framework is to leverage Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the spatial and temporal dependencies of multi-scale biological data, combined with a dynamic signal propagation model to identify key molecular interactions driving bone remodeling. 

## Overview

Bone remodeling is a dynamic process regulated by complex signaling pathways and molecular interactions. Traditional methods often struggle to capture this dynamic nature, especially when influenced by pharmacological agents. This work presents a deep learning framework that integrates various techniques, including GNNs, predictive pharmacological interaction models, and combinatorial drug effect analysis, to advance the understanding of drug-induced changes in bone formation and resorption pathways.

## Key Features
- **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to model spatial and temporal dependencies of biological data.
- **Dynamic Signal Propagation Model** for identifying key molecular interactions driving bone remodeling.
- **Predictive Pharmacological Interaction Model** for quantifying drug-target interactions, assessing systemic impacts, and simulating off-target effects.
- **Combinatorial Drug Effect Evaluation** to analyze synergistic and antagonistic effects of multiple agents.
- **Precision Medicine**: Enables the development of safer and more effective therapeutic strategies for bone health.
